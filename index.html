                So far, I have produced the general structure of my interactive article webpage.
                I have decided the topic/question I want to address with my exploratory visualizations.
                I also incorporated the big picture visualization with interactive elements (filtering, tooltips).
                The most challenging aspect of my project to design will be making the page dynamic rather than purely static.
                I want the user to be able to navigate the exploratory visuals in a creative way, rather than simply displaying raw data with simple graphs.
                I will try to use elements we learned throughout the quarter to make the article as interactive and engaging as possible.
                I am still brainstorming ways to incorporate engagement and interaction.
