      <h1>The U.S. Affordability Crisis</h1>
      <p>Rising inflation and stagnating incomes have made the American Dream unaffordable for many.</p>

  <p>
    Affordability has become one of the most pressing concerns facing the American middle-class.
    Essential expenses such as housing, groceries, and childcare have risen considerably over time.
    A common counterpoint is that prices have actually remained stable if you adjust for inflation.  
    Yet, to millions of families, life undeniably feels more expensive than ever.
    This project explores why economic data often fails to capture lived experience by examining how shifts in wages, prices, and macroeconomic conditions have 
    contributed to today's affordability challenges.

  <h2>1. Income vs Cost of Living</h2>
  <p>
    See how incomes and the cost of living have pulled apart from 1970 to 2020.
    Step through key eras to watch the gap widen between GNI index (Gross National Income per Capita) and CPI (Consumer Price Index).

      <p id="era-description">
        High inflation and slow growth begin to push the cost of living up faster than incomes.
      </p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
  Each series is expressed as an index with 1970 as the baseline, allowing changes over time to be compared on
  the same scale. GNI is indexed by dividing each year's value by the 1970 value and multiplying by 100. CPI is
  indexed by compounding annual inflation rates forward from 1970, which reflects how cumulative price changes
  accumulate over time.</p>
  <p>
  The gap between CPI and GNI widens over time, showing that the cost of living has increased far more rapidly
  than income. Even though incomes did grow, cumulative inflation outpaced those gains. 
  This divergence illustrates why many Americans perceive life as more
  expensive despite measurable economic growth.

  <h2>2. Macroeconomic Trends Over Time</h2>
  <p>Wages and prices alone don't capture the full economic picture. To understand today's
  affordability challenges, it's important to examine how broader economic indicators
  have evolved over time—including economic output, household spending, and national investment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use the sliders below to explore how much each metric has grown (or declined) over a select time period.
    Each band represents one economic metric as an area chart.
    Hover over the name of a metric to see what it measures.

  <p>
  Measures such as GDP per capita, income per capita, and national investment all rose considerably, indicating broad 
  economic expansion over time. 
  However, the substantial growth of these measures did not translate into improved household financial well-being.
  </p>
  <p>
  The steep rise in household consumption and national expenditure suggests that Americans are spending more than ever, while wage-growth 
  has not consistently kept pace with these increases. Together, these trends provide critical context for today's affordability 
  concerns: the economy has expanded on paper, yet everyday financial pressures—such as housing, healthcare, and essential goods—
  have risen faster than what many households actually earn.

                So far, I have produced the general structure of my interactive article webpage.
                I have decided the topic/question I want to address with my exploratory visualizations.
                I also incorporated the big picture visualization with interactive elements (filtering, tooltips).
                The most challenging aspect of my project to design will be making the page dynamic rather than purely static.
                I want the user to be able to navigate the exploratory visuals in a creative way, rather than simply displaying raw data with simple graphs.
                I will try to use elements we learned throughout the quarter to make the article as interactive and engaging as possible.
                I am still brainstorming ways to incorporate engagement and interaction.
                Here are some of the ways I am aiming to add engagement and interactivity:

    In summary, measurable economic gains have not translated into greater economic security for the average American. 
    These visualizations reveal the growing disconnect between macroeconomic
    growth and everyday economic reality.
