      <h1>The U.S. Affordability Crisis</h1>
      <p>Rising inflation and stagnating incomes have made the American Dream unaffordable for many.</p>

<section id="overview">
  <p>
    Affordability has become one of the most pressing concerns facing the American middle-class.
    Essential expenses such as housing, groceries, and childcare have risen considerably over time.
    A common argument is that prices have remained stable "when adjusted for inflation".  
    Yet to millions of families, life undeniably feels more expensive than ever.
    This project explores why economic data often fails to capture lived experience by examining how shifts in wages, prices, and macroeconomic conditions have 
    contributed to today’s affordability challenges.

  <h2>1. Income vs Cost of Living</h2>
  <p>
    See how incomes and the cost of living have pulled apart from 1970 to 2020.
    Step through key eras to watch the gap widen between GNI index (Gross National Income per Capita) and CPI (Consumer Price Index).

                So far, I have produced the general structure of my interactive article webpage.
                I have decided the topic/question I want to address with my exploratory visualizations.
                I also incorporated the big picture visualization with interactive elements (filtering, tooltips).
                The most challenging aspect of my project to design will be making the page dynamic rather than purely static.
                I want the user to be able to navigate the exploratory visuals in a creative way, rather than simply displaying raw data with simple graphs.
                I will try to use elements we learned throughout the quarter to make the article as interactive and engaging as possible.
                I am still brainstorming ways to incorporate engagement and interaction.
                Here are some of the ways I am aiming to add engagement and interactivity:
